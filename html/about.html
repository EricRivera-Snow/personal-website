        <h3>Snowboarding</h3>

              I have been snowbarding since 2008 and have worked to improve my
              riding every year.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am an instructor at a mountain in New Hampshire, where I teach
              beginner and intermediate riders the foundational skills required
              to get down the mountain in a fun and effective way.
            </li>
            <li>
              I recently picked up splitboarding, which is where I use a
              snowboard that can transition to skis to enable me to climb
              mountains. This requires specific avalance and outdoor navigation
              knowledge.

        <h3>Skateboarding</h3>

              I've recently picked up skateboarding, both short and long boards.
            </li>
            <li>
              When in college, I used to downhill longboard, with racing
              leathers and a full-face helment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now I primarly shortboard, focusing on trick progressions,
              especially ones that can supplement my Skateboarding.

              I'm a big fan of live music, specifically rock (emo, screamo,
              metal, indie, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              I've seen so many shows and gone to a few big music festivals,
              like When We Were Young and Adjacent Festival. I have seen bands
              like Blink-182, My Chemical Romance, A Day to Remember, Pierce the
              Veil, the Used, Taking Back Sunday, and many, many more.
